# sn0wtool

SN0WTOOL is an utility for jailbroken iOS devices. SN0WTOOL allows scripting for iOS. Updates for scripts and sources can be updated OTA (over the air), just hit update and you will have the latest scripts! SN0WTOOL runs on your MAC, not the iDevice self. Just Jailbreak with Checkra1n and SN0WTOOL will detect your device (even when locked!).

Will add more to the readme later!

Message to all developers: contact me on twitter @ik_is_jolle. Than I can add your sources file.

Have fun!

PS: Compiled + windows version soon!
